This page is related to our new research: "APTracker". The malware sample files from this dataset will be published on this page following the publication of the paper. What is now on this page is an analysis of some of the malware families in this dataset from a malware analyst's perspective, as well as a list of malware samples from the dataset, identified by several characters of their hashes in the list (as proof of concept). After the publication of the article, the full list will be made available.
